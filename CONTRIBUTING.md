# Contributing

We appreciate contributions of any kind - new contributions
are welcome whether it's through bug reports or new pull requests.

## Tell us about enhancements and bugs

Please add an issue. We'll review it, add labels and reply when we get the chance.

## See an issue you'd like to work on

Comment on the issue that you'd like to work on and we'll add the
`claimed` label.  If you see the `claimed` label already on the issue you
might want to ask the contributor if they'd like some help.

## Documentation needs updating

Go right ahead! Just submit a pull request when you're done.

## Pull Requests

We love pull requests from everyone:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository:
2. Clone forked repository `git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/Nyx.git`
3. Branch of the `main` branch.
4. Make changes, push changes to your fork and submit a pull request against the `master` branch.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within few days. We may suggest some
changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

1. Write a [good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
2. Make sure all tests and lint checks are passing (review them on the pull request page)
3. Update [README](README.md) with any changes are needed
4. Write tests (if needed)
