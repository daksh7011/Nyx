    <!--Color-->

    <!--Material uses an organized approach to applying color by -->
    <!--providing a set of attributes which define semantically named -->
    <!--colors for generalized UI concepts such as backgrounds, -->
    <!--surfaces, type and icons. Using these attributes throughout -->
    <!--your app makes it easy to change a single color, or the -->
    <!--entire theme, and have those changes cascade through the interface.-->

    <!--Color is customized by overriding Material Components color -->
    <!--attributes with custom color values. In this project, your themeâ€™s -->
    <!--color attributes are already overridden with default values -->
    <!--defined in this file, colors.xml. This file holds the color palette -->
    <!--for both light and dark themes of the Material baseline (default) -->
    <!--theme. Next to each color is a comment describing the semantic theme -->
    <!--color attribute which the palette color maps to.-->

    <!--Replace the colors here with your own brand's palette and ensure -->
    <!--they are applied as desired in both light and dark theme -->
    <!--(values/themes.xml and values-night/themes.xml). For more -->
    <!--information on color palettes and their application color -->
    <!--theme attributes, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owkf8DhAOSo-->
